## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

require(knitr)
require(ggplot2)
opts_knit$set(echo=F)

ggplot(diamonds,aes(x=carat,y=price,color=cut))+geom_point()

##调整颜色

ggplot(diamonds,aes(x=carat,y=price,color=cut))+geom_point()+
scale_color_manual(values = c("#000000","#E69F00","#56B4E9","#009E73","#F0E442","#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7"))
